# CircularNav

I was looking for circular navigation that would be generic. I needed it to display a list of links evenly around the circle regardless of the number of items the list has.<br/>

I could not find a solution for what I needed, Most of the solutions were too complicated, so I decided to build my own that would do the trick.<br/>

If anyone has a better solution to what I created please feel free to add 
any improvements so it can be better.<br/>
